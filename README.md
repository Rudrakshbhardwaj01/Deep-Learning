# Deep-Learning

Welcome to my personal deep learning repository. 
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the [CampusX YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX) series: **“[100 Days of Deep Learning.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn&si=-xunnO5Tvf93Hws6)”** Here, you’ll find hands-on implementations, experiments, and notes as I explore the fascinating world of deep learning — step by step, lesson by lesson.

##  About the Repository

This repo mirrors my progress through the CampusX series, aiming to:

- **Solidify understanding** by coding everything from scratch.
- Cover **core concepts**, mathematical foundations, and practical applications.
- Include **model implementations**, experiments, and exercises inspired by the course.

Each notebook or script reflects my personal take and learning on a specific deep learning topic.
