## Perceptron Loss Algorithm from Scratch

Implemented the **Perceptron Loss Algorithm** completely from scratch, covering its **loss function derivation and weight update rule**.  
Used **Scikit-learn** to generate the dataset, **NumPy** for mathematical computations, **Oracle** to simplify calculations, and **Matplotlib** for visualization.
