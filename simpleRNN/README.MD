# Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis with Keras

This repository provides a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating **text preprocessing** and **sentiment analysis** techniques using Keras. The examples progress from simple encoding methods to more advanced embedding-based models, making it suitable for anyone learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) with deep learning.

## Notebooks Overview

- **integerEncodingExample** – Demonstrates how to convert text into sequences of integers, providing a foundational understanding of text preprocessing.  
- **sentimentAnalysisUsingIntegerEncoding** – Applies integer encoding in a complete sentiment analysis workflow on textual data.  
- **embeddingExample** – Introduces word embeddings to represent words as dense vectors and explains their advantages over simple integer encoding.  
- **sentimentAnalysisUsingEmbeddings** – Implements sentiment analysis using embedding layers, highlighting the improved performance and representation capabilities of embeddings.
