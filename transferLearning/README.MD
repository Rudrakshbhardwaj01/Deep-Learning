# Transfer Learning in Deep Learning

This repository demonstrates transfer learning techniques in deep learning using pre-trained models. It includes implementations for feature extraction, using pre-trained models as-is, and fine-tuning for specific tasks. The examples show how to leverage existing models to save training time, improve accuracy, and adapt to new datasets efficiently.
